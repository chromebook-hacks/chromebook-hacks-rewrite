Before starting this guide, we first have to check some key information about your Chromebook.

#### Section I - Finding Your Board

1. Go to `chrome://version` in a new tab
1. Find the line that says "Platform" and then find the text that says `stable-channel`. Find the one-word board codename after that. This is your *board name*. Save it off somewhere, you'll need it in a bit.

If chrome://version is blocked, open Settings, go to About ChromeOS, click Additional details, click the copy icon, and paste the text into an editor to view the details.


#### Section II - Crosh Checks

1. Now, we're going to check if various versions of `crosh`, the ChRomeOs developer SHell are accessable on your device.
1. First, try to visit the following site: `chrome-extension://nkoccljplnhpfnfiajclkommnmllphnl//html/crosh.html`. If it is blocked by an extension (such as GoGuardian or Securly) but doesn't display a "This page has been blocked by your administrator" page with a frowning page icon, or is unblocked altogether, then you can skip the next steps.
1. If that didn't work, press `Ctrl+Alt+T`. A tab will open. If it too is blocked by an extension but does not produce a "This application is blocked by your administrator" error, then you can continue to the next step. If it is accessable, then you can also proceed.

#### Section III - Checking Google Services and Kiosk Apps

1. Open your Files app. Check if you have a tab on the left labeled "Google Drive".
1. Next, check for the Google Play app on your device.
1. Log out of your device (`Ctrl+Shift+Q` twice)
1. Look at the bottom left of the screen for an "Apps" option. Remember if this option is there.

#### Section IV - Select a Method

To find the correct exploit method for your device, please enter the system version you found in Sections I, II, and III.
