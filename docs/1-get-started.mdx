Before starting this guide, we first have to check two things: your Chromebook's kernver and your board name.

#### Section I - Finding Your Board and Kernver

1. Press ESC + ↻ + ⏻ to reboot into recovery mode.
1. Look at the bottom where it would either say something like "DUFFY-NISD" or "SORAKA C7B-A3A-F3P-28J-Y7Y". The first word (in this case DUFFY or SORAKA) is your codename, the rest is irrelevant.
1. Now, checking your kernver, simply press tab and look for where it says kernver=0x00000000 (or something similar). The last number is your kernver.
1. To get your board name from your codename, simply go to [this website](http://cros.tech/). Enter your codename in the search bar and it should pop up with your model and a version list. Under the model name will be "board:" followed by your board name.


#### Section II - Select a Method

Now that we have your board name and kernver, we can select an exploit method.

If you are on kernver 3 or below, great! You can use the [BadRecovery](exploits/badrecovery) method.

If you are on kernver 4 or above, you can use [BR1CK](http://br1ck.vercel.app/).
