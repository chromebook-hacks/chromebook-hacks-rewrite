## Prerequisites

- A screwdriver, small enough to take off the back of your Chromebook

## Section I - Opening the Device

This part shouldn't be hard: just pop open the back of your Chromebook with a screwdriver.

## Section II - Taking Out the Battery

Find the battery on your motherboard and unplug it. It's not strictly neccecary to remove it altogether, but if you want to, you can. For the rest of this guide (up untill the point that you're unenrolled), operate the Chromebook from its charger, without the battery. At the point that you are properly unenrolled, you can proceed to shut down the device, unplug it, and re-attach the battery, then close everything up again.

## Section II - Next Steps

:::tip[Next]

Now, continue on the exploit chain to [Sh1mmer Unenrollment](../exploits/sh1mmer).
