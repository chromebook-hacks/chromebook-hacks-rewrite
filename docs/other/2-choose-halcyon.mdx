## Section I - Overview of Exploits

Your device is compatible with two exploit chains - E-Halcyon and traditional WP-disabled unenrollment. Read below for more information to choose between the exploits.

+ E-Halcyon
  + Pros
    + Can be booted temporarily or installed to the drive in semi-tethered mode
    + Provides a fully unenrolled environment on v107
    + "Just works" exploit, quick and easy setup
  + Cons
    + Requires a USB drive at every boot to startup, will display "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" if E-Halcyon is installed in semi-tethered mode
    + Won't "phone home" to GAC - you'll have to recover every couple of days for device information to update it if that's a concern for you
    + User data isn't saved between reboots due to cryptohome issues
    + Requires a Linux system to build
+ WP-disabled Unenrollment + fakemurk (murkmod)
  + Pros
    + Spoofs enrollment, will update GAC data without sending devmode status
    + Powerful exploit - provides utilities, full Crouton and Chromebrew
    + Semi-unenrolled environment on v105
    + Policy modification via Pollen, devpolicy modification via Lilac
  + Cons
    + Requires disassembly of Chromebook to disable firmware write-protect
    + Not noob-friendly, requires basic knowledge of using a terminal and a Linux system to build

## Section II - Choosing Next Steps

Chosen an exploit chain? Great! Select a next step below.

If you want to boot E-Halcyon or install it in semi-tethered mode, continue to [SH1mmer Unenrollment](sh1mmer)

Or, if you want to disable WP and unenroll normally, continue to [Identifying Firmware WP](other/identify-wp)
