## Prerequisites

- A screwdriver, small enough to take off the back of your Chromebook

## Section I - Opening the Device

This part shouldn't be hard: just pop open the back of your Chromebook with a screwdriver.

## Section II - Identifying the Switch/Jumper

Look around in the guts of your Chromebook and try to find a single, isolated switch. If you don't find any, also look for a jumper. If there is a jumper, follow the excellent guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDCMjM2-oGo) (yes, that is a specific model of Chromebook, but you can probably follow the instructions for your model too).

If there is a switch, literally just flick it. That's it. You're done.

## Section III - Close It Back Up

Put the case on. If the jumper is loose now, just shove it down so it fits. Screw everything back together, then continue.

## Section II - Next Steps
