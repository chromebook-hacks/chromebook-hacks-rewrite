title: "Installing Murkmod"

:::warning 

Users have reported that murkmod is buggy and may break your device. Proceed with caution.

:::

## Section I - Disable Extensions (if neccecary)

Try to open crosh (`Ctrl+Alt+T`). If you can't open crosh due to an extension block, then create a new folder in your Downloads named `disable-extensions`. Fakemurk will automagically disable extensions so you can use crosh.

## Section II - Setup Fakemurk

You will be prompted to opt-in to analytics. Murkmod does not contain analytics, so this will be a one-time operation. Fakemurk analytics are anonymous and I  reccomend you enable them.

## Section III - Setup Murkmod

Once in crosh/mush, select "Root Shell" by entering `1` and pressing `Enter`. Then, run the following command:

```sh
bash <(curl -SLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainestorme/murkmod/main/murkmod.sh)
```

Answer the prompts and setup will continue. The tab will close automatically once finished.

## Section IV - Next Steps

You're almost there! Continue to [Finalizing Setup](finalizing-setup).
