## Why do this?
Sometimes, your school district websites (I-Ready for example) might have requirements for Chrome.

If you downgraded to [fakemurk](../fakemurk), this is very useful.

## Prerequisites
- Fakemurk (optional)
- Murkmod (optional)
- Access to developer mode on `chrome://extensions`

## Section I - Enabling Developer Mode
Head on over to `chrome://extensions` and, in the top right, you will find a Developer Mode toggle.

If this is blocked for you, install [fakemurk](../fakemurk)

Once you've enabled it you are good to go.

## Section II - Getting a UserAgent Switcher
Download the source code for the [UserAgent-Switcher](https://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/archive/refs/tags/v0.6.2.zip)

Once downloaded, go into your Files app and extract the files. 

After that go back to `chrome://extensions` and click `Load Unpacked`.

Click on the folder you extracted, head into the `v3` directory and click `Open`.

You have officially installed the extension.

## Section III - Next Steps
It is recommended that you pin the extension for easier access.

Click on the extension and make sure to select `Chrome`, `Windows`, and then the latest version of Chrome.

You can now access all your school services again!

You're almost there! Continue to [Finalizing Setup](../finalizing-setup) to finish!
